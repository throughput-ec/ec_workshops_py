You can use HTML and LaTeX here to do more formatting. \n\nUnlike Jupyter, code and text do not render on their own; you will need to \"knit\" (render) the whole document in order to see the rendered output. \n\nClicking the \"Knit\" button on the top to render the docuemnt:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module5/01_knit_button.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Binder\" width=45% align=\"center\">\n \n---\n\nWhen you \"knit\" a Markdown (`.md`) file will be created and a new window will pop up with your rendered document (usually a `.pdf` or `.html` document). \n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module5/02_rmd.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Binder\" width=45% align=\"center\">\n\n---\n\n## Rendering Often\n\nIt is important to \"knit\" as often as you make important changes.\n\nOtherwise, an error in a LaTeX equation or a code chunk will stop the rendering process resulting in an error. \n\nIf you have a long document, it might be harder to identify what went wrong, so it is important to render often so that you will easily identify and fix errors. \n\n---\n\n## Creating code chunks\n\nInstead of code cells as in Jupyter, R Markdown has code chunks. \n\nTo start a Code Chunk: \n- Write 3 backticks (\\`\\`\\`) followed by curly braces containing the language engine you want to run (usually r): `{r}`. \n- If you want to use python, do `{python}`\n\n- Code is entered on the lines below.\n\n- To finish a Code Chunk, close it with 3 more backticks (\\`\\`\\`).\n\n---\n<img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module5/05_code_chunk.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Binder\" width=45% align=\"center\">\n\n- Code chunks are run when you knit the entire document. \n- The code in the chunk and the code output will be included in your rendered Markdown (`.md`) document. \n\n---\n\n## Naming Code Chunks and Markdown sections\n\nWhen you include Markdown headers (`#` symbol) R Studio automatically creates a pop-up-like menu for you to use to navigate the document:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module5/06_title_navigator.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Binder\" width=45% align=\"center\">\n\n---\n\nYou can also name Code Chunks by writing the desired name after the language engine inside the curly braces:\n```{r my-name}\n# This code chunk is named my-name\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module5/07_code_navigator.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Binder\" width=45% align=\"center\">\n\nBy clicking on any of the options in the pop-up-like menu, RStudio will navigate you to that section of the R Markdown document. \n\nWARNING: Do not duplicate code chunk names.\n\n---\n\n## Code Chunk Options\n\nThere are many code chunk options that you can set, for example:\n- Choose whether a chunk is evaluated - allowing you to ignore code that may have errors and still render the Rmd file.\n- Choose Whether to include the output in the rendered document\n- Lots of ther [options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#chunk-options) document.\n\n---\n## Code Chunk Options\n\n- Code Chunk options can be set at a global level or locally for a specific chunk.\n- Global options are set in one chunk at the top of the document. For example:\n\n```{r, setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  comment = '', fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6\n)\n```\n\n- Global chuncks are set by adding them as arguments to the function `knitr::opts_chunk$set(...)`\n\n---\n\n## Code Chunk Options\n\n- Local chunk options are set by adding the options in the curly braces of a code chunk after the language engine and code chunk name. For example:\n\n```{r correlation no warning, warning = FALSE}\ncor( c( 1 , 1 ), c( 2 , 3 ) )\n```\n\n- Separate multiple options in a code chunk with a comma. \n\n---\n\n## Document output options\n\n- Besides Markdown text and code chunks, you can add an optional YAML header to your document.\n\n- Specify a YAML header surrouding it with `---`\n\n- Include:\n  - title\n  - author\n  - output\n  - etc\n---\n\n## Example YAML Header**\n\n~~~\n ---\n title: \"Finding coordinates in a map\"\n author: \"My Name\"\n date: \"December 07, 2021\"\n output: html\n ---\n~~~\n\n---\n\nOutput options include:\n\n- `output: github_document`\n- `output: html_document`\n- `output: pdf_document`\n- [others](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/output-formats.html)","fields":{"slug":"/chapter5_02_creating_an_Rmd_file"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<div><h1><img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module1/00_ec_slide1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"EC Theme\" width=25% align=\"left\"/> Lesson 4<br>Creating an RStudio Project</h1></div>\n\n---\n\n# What is an R Project?\n\n- A directory containing a special file: `*.Rproj`\n\n- Allows you to do the following:\n\n  - use RStudio as a Git client\n\n  - stop using `setwd()` to set your working directory\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- To create a new R Project: \n  * From the menu clcik on: \n      File -> New Project\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module5/09_rproj.png?raw=true\" alt=\"RProject\" width=45% align=\"center\">\n\n---\n\n- A pop up will show up.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module5/10_rproj.png?raw=true\" alt=\"RProject\" width=45% align=\"center\">\n\n---\n\n## Creating RStudio projects\n\nYou can choose if you want to start a new project from:\n- A GitHub repository\n- An existing directory\n- A completely new directory\n\n---\n\n## Creating from a completely new directory\n\n- Click on `New Directory`\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module5/11_rproj.png?raw=true\" alt=\"RProject\" width=45% align=\"center\">\n\n---\n\n- Name the project and browse where would you like to set it up.\n\n- Optionally, you can also set up a new git repository from here.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module5/12_rproj.png?raw=true\" alt=\"RProject\" width=45% align=\"center\">\n\n---\n\nIf you already have a git repository\n\n1.

You can transform an R Markdown file in two ways:\n  * `knit` - knitr will run each chunk of code in the document and append the results of the code to the document next to the code chunk. This workflow facilitates reproducible reports.\n\n  * `convert` - The rmarkdown package will use the pandoc program to transform the file into a new format such as: HTML, PDF, or Microsoft Word file.

They will get exactly the same results.\n\n- Docker allows you to wrangle dependencies (from the operating system up to details such as R, python and Latex package versions).\n\n- It makes sure that your analyses are reproducible.\n\n- It makes your analysis **portable**  and **sharable**.\n\n---\n## Important Vocabulary\n\nThrough our journey with Docker, the following terms might come often:\n\n- Virtual Machine\n- Container\n- Docker Image\n- Docker Container\n\n---\n\n### Virtual Machine\n- Not different from your tangible computer/phone/server.\n\n- A VM has its own CPU, storage, memory, and access to the internet.\n\n- software-based versions of a computer sorted in a file tipically called an **image**\n\n- A *VM image* is a set of instructions on how exactly to assemble the code and achieve a desired software configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Container\n- Software executable bundles where the bins, libraries, and dependencies are packaged alongside their code under a standardized framework.\n\n- Lightweight images of application can then be run anywhere: desktop, cloud, etc...\n\n- This avoids the \"It works on my machine\" problem.\n\n- \"docker\" and \"containers\" are terms that currently, people use interchaingeable.\n\n---\n\n### Docker Image\n\n- Source code for binaries, libraries, tools, dependencies that are required to function as an application.\n\n- When Docker runs an image, it becomes a container.\n\n- One image can be the base for multiple containers that share commonalities.\n\n- You can add several \"layers\" of images on top of the container layer. \n\n---\n\n### Docker Container\n\n- What we ultimately build: the application that is completely interactable by users and administrators.\n\n- Remember Docker Images are a set of instructions to build a container.\n\n- This is the \"background service\" that runs the Docker operations.\n\n- Keeps track of Docker operations and assigns them with proper tags.\n\n---\n\n# Let's Practice!\n","fields":{"slug":"/chapter6_01_introduction_to_docker"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<div><h1><img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module1/00_ec_slide1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"EC Theme\" width=25% align=\"left\"/> Lesson 0<br>Learning Outcomes</h1></div>\n\n---\n\nBy the end of this module, you should be able to:\n\n- Understand what Docker is\n- Use Docker Images from the DockerHub\n- Create your own Docker Images\n\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--up7-nOgB--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/mfnwwxkfx46xzrlndw12.png\" alt=\"Motivation Docker\" width=50% align=\"center\">\n\n\n---\n\n# Let's Get Started!","fields":{"slug":"/chapter6_00_learning_outcomes"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<div><h1><img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module1/00_ec_slide1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"EC Theme\" width=25% align=\"left\"/> Lesson 2<br>Launching Docker</h1></div>\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n- Follow the installation instructions. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). \n\n- You will be directed to several tutorials. Feel free to take a look at them.\n\n---\n\n## Launching Our First Docker Image\n\n1. Launch Docker is to open a Unix Shell:\n  - On Mac or Windows, use the `Docker Quickstart Terminal` that you installed.\n  - On a Linux machine, use a terminal prompt.\n\n2. We are going to use a pre-existing image: [rocker/geospatial](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/geospatial). \n\n3. In the `Docker Quickstart Terminal` type:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -p 8787:8787 rocker/geospatial\n```\n\n---\n\n## Launching Our First Docker Image\n\n`*p` and `--rm` are flags that customize how the container is run. \n\n`-p` : This is the port that you need to specify where you will be working.  \nSince we specified that we wanted to use port 8787 in our command line, we need to go to:\nhttp://localhost:8787/\n\n`-–rm`: delete the container when it is quitted. Otherwise, a version of it will be saved to our local computer.  \nContainers can occupy a lot of disk space.\n\n---\n## Launching Our First Docker Image\n\n- You should see:\n````markdown\n                        ##         .\n                  ## ## ##        ==\n               ## ## ## ## ##    ===\n           /\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\___/ ===\n      ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~\n           \\______ o           __/\n             \\    \\         __/\n              \\____\\_______/\ndocker is configured to use the default machine with IP 192.168.99.100\nFor help getting started, check out the docs at https://docs.docker.com\nThus, you would enter http://192.168.99.100:8787 in your browser as the url.\n````\n---\n\n## The Hub\n\nWhere did `rocker/geospatial` came from? \n- If you try to run a Docker container which you have not installed locally, Docker will automatically search for the container on Docker Hub (an online repository for docker images).\n- If it exists, it will download it.\n- In our case, this is the <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/geospatial\" target=\"_blank\"> Docker repository </a>\n- You can notice that it contains some instructions and all the dependencies that are included in this image.\n\n---\n\n- The command above will lead RStudio-Server to launch invisibly. \n- To connect to it, open a browser and enter `http://localhost:8787/`\n- You should see RStudio welcome screen. Log in using:\n\n```\nusername: rstudio \npassword: # given in terminal\n```\n\n---\n\n- You are able to work with RStudio in your browser in much the same way as you would on your desktop.\n\n- Look at your terminal, the password is there. You can change the password with the flag `-e PASSWORD`\n\n- Exercise: Change the login password.\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -e PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASS> -p 8787:8787 rocker/geospatial\n```\n---\n\n## Linking Volumes\n\n1. Given that we used the `--rm` flag when we launched the Docker container, anything we create on the machine will be gone. Let’s verify this.\n\n2. Open a new R script.\n\n3. Enter the following code in the script, run it and save it:\n\n```\n# make x the numbers from 1 to 5, and y the numbers from 6-10\nx <- 1:5\ny <- 6:10\n\n# plot x against y\nplot(x, y)\n```\n---\n\n## Linking Volumes\n\n4. In your files panel, you will see the new script file.\n\n5. Close the browser tab where you have RStudio open, and then go to your terminal window from where you launched the Docker container and type Contol+C. This shuts down the Docker container.\n\n6. Relaunch a Docker container using the RStudio image as you did previously:\n```\ndocker run --rm -p 8787:8787 rocker/geospatial\n```\n\n7. Go to `http://localhost:8787/` in your browser.\n\n8. The R script you created ... is... gone.\n\n---\n\n## Linking Volumes\n\n- Linking a volume allows to access data and save files in our local machine.\n\n- When launching a container, add the `-v` flag along with the path to your project’s root directory and the path to the container: \n```\ndocker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -v /Users/your_user/Documents/r_docker_tutorial:/home/rstudio/r_docker_tutorial rocker/geospatial\n```\n\n- Go then to `http://localhost:8787/` in your browser.\n\n- Set the working directory to the directory called `r_docker_tutorial`\n\n- You can load data from your computer into the launched RStudio tab.\n\n- You can save your analysis into the `r_docker_tutorial` directory.\n\n- If you created a document, when you close the RStudio browser and exit your Docker container look inside the `r_docker_tutorial` directory to find them.\n\n---\n\n# Let's Practice!","fields":{"slug":"/chapter6_02_launching_a_docker"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<div><h1><img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module1/00_ec_slide1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"EC Theme\" width=25% align=\"left\"/> Lesson 2<br>Project Organization</h1></div>\n\n---\n\n## Data analysis workflow \n\n![workflow](https://datacarpentry.org/rr-organization1/fig/workflow.png)\n\n---\n\n## Face it...\n\n- There are going to be files\n\n- LOTS of files\n\n- The files will change over time\n\n- The files will have relationships to each other\n\n---\n\n## For Your Inner Self\n\n- File organization and naming is a mighty weapon against chaos\n\n- Make a file's name and location VERY INFORMATIVE about what it is, why it exists, how it relates to other things\n\n- The more things are self-explanatory, the better\n\n---\n\n## Organizing your data analysis workflow\n\n**Raw data -> data**\n\nPick a strategy, any strategy, just pick one!\n\n<div class=\"columns-2\">\n\n![workflow_raw_data_to_data](https://datacarpentry.org/rr-organization1/fig/workflow_raw_data_to_data.png)\n\n~~~\ndata\ndata-raw\ndata-clean\ndata/\n  -

from what previous Docker image you are building this one\n    - how to configure the OS\n    - what happens when you run the container\n\n---\n## Writing a Dockerfile\n\nLet’s build a very basic Dockerfile for R. \n\nThe task to solve is:  \n```\nI have today an analysis that works in a .R file. \nI want to make sure that this analysis will always work in the future, \nregardless of any update to the packages used.\n```\n\nCreate a project folder. Then, inside this folder, in the `root`, create a new text file.\n\nSave this now empty text file as `Dockerfile`\n\n---\n\nLet's use a modified R script from module 4.\nThis is the main analysis that we will want to reproduce.\n\nSave it as `my_analysis.R`\n\n```\nlibrary(leaflet)  \nlibrary(htmlwidgets)\n\nleaflet(options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 0, maxZoom = 18))  \n\n## My Leaflet Map\n\nmap1 <- leaflet() %>%  \n  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TerrainBackground) %>%  \n  addTiles() %>%  \n  addCircleMarkers(lng =-123.241999032 , lat = 49.267665596,  \n                   popup = paste0(\"UBC\"))  \n\nmap1  \n\n## 'leaflet' objects (image above)\nsaveWidget(map1, file=\"m.html\")\n```\n\n---\n\n1. In your new Dockerfile, write the following:\n\n```\nFROM rocker/verse:latest\n```\n\nEvery Dockerfile starts with a `FROM`.  \nThis tells Docker to start with the rocker/verse base image.   \nThere are a lot of other official images, and you can also build from a local one.\n\nThis FROM is, in a way, describing the dependency of your image.\n\n**REMEMBER**\nThe `FROM` command must always be the first thing in your Dockerfile.\n\n---\n\n2. Add a layer on top of our verse. Install `leaflet` and `htmlwidgets`.\n```\nRUN R -e \"install.packages('leaflet')\"\nRUN R -e \"install.packages('htmlwidgets')\" \n```\n\n`RUN` commands in your Dockerfile execute shell commands to build up your image. \n\nYou can see that, since we are working with `R`, we use the same commands that we would use in R console.\n\n---\n\n## Building a Dockerfile\n\n4. Return to the Docker terminal.\n\n5. Build the image by doing:\n```\ndocker build -t my-r-image .\n```\n\n`-t my-r-image` names the image (use only lower case)  \n`.` says all the resources we need to build the image are in our current directory. \n\nThis step will probably take a few minutes. Depending on the complexity of your image, how long it will delay. You will see lines being printed on the Docker terminal.\n\nWait until it is done.\n\n---\n\n6. List your images via:\n```\ndocker images\n```\n7.

This means `leaflet` is pre-installed and ready to go in your new docker image.\n\n---\n\nYou can also tart the container with a mounted volume to save the output.\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -p 8787:8787 -v /Users/your_path/r_docker_tutorial:/home my-r-image\n```\n\n---\n\n## Adding Data\n\n- You may also want some some static files inside our Docker image - such as data.\n\n- Add a line in the Dockerfile:\n```\nADD data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv /home/rstudio/\n```\nRebuild your Docker image:\n```\ndocker build -t my-r-image .\n```\nAnd launch it again:\n```\ndocker run --rm -p 8787:8787 my-r-image\n```\nGo back to RStudio in the browser, and `gapminder-FiveYearData.csv` will be, present in the files visible to RStudio. \n\n---\n## Data Security\n\n- For you to load the data, you must have the CSV file in your project's root directory (or in a directory called data/ inside your root directory) in order to push it to the image. \n\n- Be careful when uploading sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n## Advanced Dockerfiles\n\nSometimes, we only want to send a Docker image that reproduces all the analysis and just outputs the results' files.\n\nWe can add a few more lines to our Dockerfile to achieve this goal.\n\n---\n\n## RUN mkdir and WORKDIR\n\nThe `mkdir` command is used to make a new directory. \nYou can use it to create the `app` or a main directory in your Dockerfile.\n\nMost importantly is the `WORKDIR` command, which will allow you to set what your working directory within Docker.\n\nAdd the following two lines to your Dockerfile\n\n```\nRUN mkdir /home/my_docker\nWORKDIR /home/my_docker\n```\n\n---\n\n## Copy\n\nLet's get our analysis script from our host machine to the container. \n\nFor that, we’ll need to use `COPY` localfile pathinthecontainer.   \nNote that here, the my_analysis.R has to be in the same folder as the Dockerfile on your computer.\n\nAdd this line to your Dockerfile\n\n```\nCOPY my_analysis.R /home/my_docker/my_analysis.R\n```\n\n---\n\n## CMD\n\nFinally `CMD`\n\nThis command will be run every time you’ll launch the docker. \n\nWe want `my_analysis.R` to be sourced.

For example, you can run a workflow to automatically add the appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your repository.\n\n- GitHub provides Linux, Windows, and macOS virtual machines to run your workflows, or you can host your own self-hosted runners in your own data center or cloud infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## Key concepts:\n\n- Actions: Individual tasks you want to perform.\n\n- Workflow: A collection of actions (specified together in one file).\n\n- Event: Something that triggers the running of a workflow.\n\n- Runner: A machine that can run the Github Action(s).\n\n- Job: A set of steps executed on the same runner.\n\n- Step: A set of commands or actions which a job executes.\n\n---\n\n## Create an example workflow\n\n1.

However, if the\nBoolean is `False`, the code stops running, and an error message is\nprinted.\n\n\n---\n\n## Example 1\n\nLet’s take a look at an example where the Boolean is `True`.\n\n``` python\nassert 1 == 1 , \"1 is not equal to 1.\"\nprint('Will this line execute?')\n```\n\nWhat do you think the output will be?\n\n---\n\nAnswer: \n\n```out\nWill this line execute?\n```\n\nHere, since the `assert` statement results in a `True` values, Python\ncontinues to run, and the next line of code is executed.\n\n---\n\n## Example 2\n\n``` python\nassert 1 == 2 , \"1 is not equal to 2.\"\nprint('Will this line execute?')\n```\n\nWhat do you think the output will be?\n\n---\n\nAnswer: \n\n``` out\nAssertionError: 1 is not equal to 2.\n\nDetailed traceback: \n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n```\n\n\nWhen an assert is thrown due to a Boolean evaluating to `False`, the\nnext line of code does not get an opportunity to be executed.\n\n---\n\n## When to test?\n\n\n- You probably are used to creating a function, and only after that,  you might want to write the tests.\n\n- Actually, writing tests should be done *before* the actual function. This is called Test-Driven Development.\n\n- This may seem a little counter-intuitive, but we’re creating the  expectations of our function before the actual function code.\n\n- Often we have an idea of what our function should be able to do and what output is expected.\n\n- Writing tests before the function, help understand what code is needed and it avoids encountering large bugs down the line.\n\n- It is recommended to write multiple tests.\n\n---\n\n## What to test?\n\n- Keep these tests simple - things that we know are true or\ncould be easily calculated by hand.\n\nFor example, let’s look at our `exponent_a_list()` function.\n\nEasy cases for this function would be lists containing numbers that we\ncan easily square or cube.\n\nFor example, we expect the square output of `[1, 2, 4, 7]` to be\n`[1, 4, 16, 49]`.\n\n---\n\n``` python\ndef exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):\n    new_exponent_list = list()\n    \n    for number in numerical_list:\n        new_exponent_list.append(number ** exponent)\n    \n    return new_exponent_list\n```\n\n``` python\nassert exponent_a_list([1, 2, 4, 7], 2) == [1, 4, 16, 49], \"incorrect output for exponent = 2\"\n```\n\n``` python\nassert exponent_a_list([1, 2, 3], 3) == [1, 8, 27], \"incorrect output for exponent = 3\"\n```\n\n``` python\nassert type(exponent_a_list([1,2,4], 2)) == list, \"output type not a list\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Systematic Approach\n\nWe use a **systematic approach** to design our function using a general\nset of steps to follow when writing programs.\n\n***1. Write the function stub: a function that does nothing but accepts\nall input parameters and returns the correct datatype.***\n\n``` python\ndef exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):\n    return list()\n```\n\n---\n\n***2.

Write code and test frequently.***\n\n``` python\ndef exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):\n    new_exponent_list = list()\n    \n    for number in numerical_list:\n        new_exponent_list.append(number ** exponent)\n    \n    return new_exponent_list\n    \nassert type(exponent_a_list([1,2,4], 2)) == list, \"output type not a list\"\nassert exponent_a_list([1, 2, 4, 7], 2) == [1, 4, 16, 49], \"incorrect output for exponent = 2\"\nassert exponent_a_list([1, 2, 3], 3) == [1, 8, 27], \"incorrect output for exponent = 3\"\n```\n\n---\n\n***5. Write documentation.***\n\n``` python\ndef exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):\n    \"\"\" Creates a new list containing specified exponential values of the input list. \n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    numerical_list : list\n        The list from which to calculate exponential values from\n    exponent : int or float, optional\n        The exponent value (the default is 2, which implies the square).\n    \n    Returns\n    -------\n    new_exponent_list : list\n        A new list containing the exponential value specified of each of\n        the elements from the input list \n        \n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> exponent_a_list([1, 2, 3, 4])\n    [1, 4, 9, 16]\n    \"\"\"\n    new_exponent_list = list()\n    for number in numerical_list:\n        new_exponent_list.append(number ** exponent)\n    return new_exponent_list\n```\n\n--- \n\n## Organizing tests\n\nTests are organised hierarchically: expectations are grouped into tests which are organised in files:\n\nAn expectation is the atom of testing:\n- It describes the expected result of a computation.

The authors provided several versions of their dataset. Post-publication peer review confirmed that none of these versions fully recapitulates the results presented in the cohort background comparisons, casting doubt on the reliability of the data. Additional concerns were raised about the randomisation procedure, as the equal distribution of male and female patients is unlikely unless sex is a parameter considered during randomisation. However, based on the clarification provided by the authors, sex was not considered during this process. The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the results and conclusions presented.\"\n\n---\n\n## When Research Goes Wrong\n\nThe problem doesn't just stop once the article is retracted.

No interpretation of the result itself as the result is a fact, an attribute of the data set you are working with.\n\nExamples:\n\nHow many people live in each US state?\n\n---\n\n## Exploratory\n\nOne in which you analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables looking for patterns that would support proposing a hypothesis to test in a future study.\n\nExamples:\n\nDoes air pollution correlate with life expectancy in a set of data collected from groups of individuals from several regions in the United States?\n\n---\n\n## Inferential\n\nOne in which you analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables in a representative sample. We want to quantify how much the patterns, trends, or relationships between variables is applicable to all individuals units in the population.\n\nExamples:\n\nIs eating at least 5 servings a day of fresh fruit and vegetables is associated with fewer viral illnesses per year?\n\n---\n\n## Predictive\n\nOne where you are trying to predict measurements or labels for individuals (people or things). Less interested in what causes the predicted outcome, just what predicts it.\n\nExamples:\n\nHow many viral illnesses will someone have next year?\n\n---\n\n## Causal\n\nAsks about whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, in a population. Sometimes the underlying design of the data collection, by default, allows for the question that you ask to be causal (e.g., randomized experiment or trial)\n\nExamples:\n\nDoes smoking lead to cancer?\n\n---\n\n## Mechanistic\n\nOne that tries to explain the underlying mechanism of the observed patterns, trends, or relationship (how does it happen?)\n\nExamples:\n\nHow does how airplane wing design changes air flow over a wing, leading to decreased drag?\n\n---\n\n## What happens next?\n\nKnowing the kind of question you are trying to answer, helps narrow down the possibilities of the kind of analysis you might want to do.\n\nFor example, if you have the question: \"How many viral illnesses will someone have next year?\" and you identify that it is predictive. You could narrow down that some kind of statistical or machine learning model might help you answer that.\n\nThen you need to go a step deeper and look at the data that you have, and see which kind of statistical or machine learning model is most suitable for your data.\n\n---\n\n# Let's Practice What We Learned","fields":{"slug":"/chapter7_03_ds_workflows"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<div><h1><img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module1/00_ec_slide1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"EC Theme\" width=25% align=\"left\"/> What We Learned</h1></div>\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n# Let's practice what we learned!","fields":{"slug":"/chapter7_07_what_we_learned"}}}]}}}
