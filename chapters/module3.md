<exercise id="1" title="Getting Started with Github">

Python and Jupyter are cool technologies, but they only scratch the surface of why you might want to adopt Python for your geoscience workflow.

This section from Project Pythia's tutorials will introduce GitHub, the de facto standard platform for collaboration and version control used by the open-source Python community.

In the last exercise, you will configure your GitHub account for secure logins via ssh and/or https.
