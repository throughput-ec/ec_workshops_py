<exercise id="1" title = "Getting Started with Python">


Read the [Quickstart zero to Python](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/quickstart.html) article.


</exercise>


<exercise id="2" title="Getting Started with Jupyter">

Read the following [article](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-jupyter.html) to know more about what Jupyter is.


Then, read this [link](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/jupyterlab.html) to learn particularly about JupyterLab. Follow the exercises on an extra tab/window using the provided [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ProjectPythia/pythia-foundations/main?urlpath=lab/tree/foundations/jupyterlab.ipynb)

</exercise>


<exercise id="3" title="Introduction to NumPy">

~~~
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object,
various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an
assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including
mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O,
discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical
operations, random simulation, and much more.
- NumPy Documentation
~~~

This section contains Project Pythia's tutorials on array computing with NumPy.
We recommend using the provided Binder link to run the code.

<exercise id="4" title="Introduction to Pandas">

Pandas is a very powerful library for working with tabular data (i.e. anything you might put in a spreadsheet â€“ a common data type in the geosciences). It allows us to use labels for our data so that we can write expressive and robust code to manipulate the data.

Key features of Pandas are the ability to read in tabular data, slice and dice data, and exploratory analysis tools native to the library.

Follow this Project Pythia tutorial on Pandas.
